# ERPNext Fiscal Year Based Date Field
ERPNext app to make date related fields respect the default fiscal year.

In ERPNext, date related fields show the current date and there is nothing wrong with that, but if you are entering historical data manually then you might end up forgetting to change the date related fields to match the default active **Fiscal Year**.
For such reason I created this to help myself and others with such issue.
